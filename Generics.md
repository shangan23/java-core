### Generics

Generics in Java class enables you to specify type parameters while defining class, methods and interfaces. Type parameters is the type of data which class or method or interface operates on.

Naming convention in general are represented with Single Upper case letters like T,K,V,E..etc
- T for Type
- K for Key
- V for Value
- N for Number
- E for Element	

### Benefits of `Generics` in Java
- Stronger Type checks at Compile time.
- Casting is not required.
- Enabling programmers to implement Generic Algorithms.

### Points to remember
- Type safety since stronger type check at compile time.
- Generics don't work with primitive data type arguments.
- Can have generic class, methods and interfaces
- Cannot declare `static` class member for Generic type arguments
